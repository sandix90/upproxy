I used Sanic because it provides async requests, plus async httpx requests to the website

Use command to build image
```docker build -t uptest . ```

To start project
```docker run --name upproxy uptest:latest ```

Links on the haven't been replaced, because this manipulation is damaged css, js files.
You must paste a link into the address bar. Like this (http://localhost:9000/topics/health/)
You can use every link in the website and script will add beautiful emojies to the words.
